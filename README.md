### Backseat Writer

a toy text editor that uses LLMs (BYOK) to impersonate your audience, a writing
coach, the inverse piramid method, Hacker News mean commenters, Stephen King or
more likely to nag you while you try to get your blogpost written. Works for me
at least. Not sure if it improves my writing but it makes it more fun.

## Why?

because how else would I burn my free credits?

## How?

write your stuff, hit "get feedback" and convert energy to heat. Also Comments
should appear, notion-like.

You can configure your own personas with custom prompt, so you can
passive-aggresively demand that your grammar checker stop correcting your
british english spelling, if you are into that. It mostly works depending on the
model. I find the dumb models to be more fun.
